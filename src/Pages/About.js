        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>Art is not just a luxury or a form of self-expression, it is a severelly undervalued and missunderstood work, unique to Humanity. It has the power to unite the people, inspire the mind, and illuminate the spirit. We believe art should be accessible to everyone, including those that cannot practice it or afford it. Thus, we aim in producing art that is both affordable to all, and caters to the individual tastes.</p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>By leveraging the advantages of Addictive manunfacturing techniques, specifically 3D printing, we produce artworks available in the public domain. We focus on a small set of an ever expanding gallery and readily available designs.</p>
        <p>In focusing our efforts in those designs, as opposed to simply creating any design, we can prepare and tune our equipment in order to print these with minimum human input, thus we are able to achieve a lower printing cost than regular companies over the long term.</p>
        <p>With this, we are able to tap into a niche market that is too expensive for other mass production methods, due to low volume demand, as well as get an upperhand over our competitors with significantly cheaper and higher quality products.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Like many other 3D print buisnesses, it all started with a single printer meant for a hobbying, it was only suppose to produce some replacemant and custom parts for other works, and an eventual piece. Unfortunatelly, that printer was lacking in both precision and quality, and soon afterwards, a more professional one was aquired.</p>
        <p>Eventually, with the word spreading, people started asking for custom prints, and with the requests coming in, so came in the difficulies and learning experiences. We foud out that, in spite of so many people having their own desktop printers, most could not grasp the difficulties in producing high quality prints, due to their poor understanding of the technology and the several factors that impact the final result.</p>
        <p>We eventually realized that there was an opportunity for a niche market, one in wich the buisnesses were too expensive for the common folk, and personal producers were simply incapable of satisfying results. With this information in hand, and the understanding that there is both a niche gap in the marketplace, and a method to fufill it, the concept for this buisness became self evident. With this, the foundations were established, and this shop was open for buisness.</p>
